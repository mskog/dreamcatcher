# Dreamcatcher
A needlessly complicated Docker based..thing..to monitor and add images from 4chan to your Picyo services

# Disclaimer
This project is not affiliated with 4chan in any way.

### Please do not use this to make a "clone" of 4chan by downloading and rehosting images with ads around them or something similar. Do not fire up 8 million docker containers to pull down the entire 4chan site at once. This is strictly a for-fun project to test some Docker stuff and to have something to test Picyo with.
